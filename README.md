# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The code attempts to access an array element outside of its valid index range, leading to a runtime exception.

The `bug.java` file contains the faulty code. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array index boundaries to prevent such errors.
